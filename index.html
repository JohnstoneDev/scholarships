                    <h1>About the scholarship.</h1>
            <p>Each year, a $1,000.00 scholarship will be awarded to a promising form one student at Lubinu Girls Secondary School, a school that was very dear and close to his heart. This scholarship will assist with tuition costs and expenses.
                </p>
            <p>Awarding of the Jackson Nyangweso Osundwa scholarship is contingent on several criteria including expression of need and a complete application. Additionally, applicants are required to submit an essay demonstrating their passion to create a better world. Scholarship recipients are expected to use their resources wisely, maintain consistent good grades, and uphold a high standard of conduct.
                The J.N.O Scholarship award is an outright grant. Although recipients are under no obligation to make repayment, it is our hope that once graduated and engaged in a productive career, they will help honor the memory of Mzee Osundwa  by paying it forward and giving future students a similar opportunity.
